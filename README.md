# C New Tecnology Standard Libray
C New Technology Standard Library is a standard library developed by Sahne Dünya for the programming language called C New Technology. C New Technology is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya based on C/C++ but equipped with more modern features. The main purpose of its creation is that C/C++ alternatives such as D and Rust are not directly compatible, C New Technology is directly compatible with these languages. This is very important because throughout history C/C++ has been indispensable in system programming and high-performance applications. However, one of the biggest problems is that they lack modern features. Since alternatives are not directly compatible with D and Rust languages, they can become popular in a longer time. C New Technology can remain popular in a shorter time if sufficient support is seen and also thanks to this, this programming language can take over. If sufficient support is applied. Even better news is that C New Technology is independent of ISO standards and is open source.
